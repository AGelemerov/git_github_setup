## Python set up with PyCharm
- Ensure you have Python version 3.7+ installed
- Install PyCharm (remember to check the box with "Add Python to PATH")
- To ensure everything is setup correctly, write a simple "hello world" command
- 
## Python variables
- Variables are something we store data in
- This data can be of many types including
### Data Types
- String (str)
- Integer (int)
- Float (float) (stands for floating point number, meaning decimal point)
- Boolean (bool)
- Character (char)
- List (list)
- Etc.

- `print("Hello World")`
```python
# TASK
first_name = input("Please enter your first name. ")
last_name = input("Please enter your last name. ")
DOB = input("Please enter your date of birth (dd/mm/yyyy). ")
course_name = input("Please enter your course name. ")
UK_resident = input("Are you a UK resident? ")

print("Hello " + first_name + " " + last_name)
print("Date of birth: " + DOB)
print("Course name is: " + course_name)
print("Answer to: Are you a UK resident: " + UK_resident)
 ```
```python

# Dynamically typed language
# Python variables
# We use variables to store data
# To store user data - hard code data - any other type
# first_name = "Angel" - String/str
# last_name = "Gelemerov"
"""
DOB = 99 - Integer/int
UK resident = yes/no - Boolean/bool
salary = 40000 - Integer/int
travel = 15.4 - Float/float
gross_salary = "salary + travel"
"""
#
# first_name = "Angel"
# last_name = "Gelemerov"
# salary = 50
# travel = 0.5
#
# # print("Angel")
# print(first_name)
# print(last_name)
# print(salary)
# print(travel)
#
# # how to find out the type of the data stored in the variable
# print(type(salary))
#
# print("Good Morning, please enter your name")
#
# name = input()
# print(name)
# print("Hello " + name)
```
